**2. It is hypothesized that students in College Algebra skip class less often than students in General Chemistry I; both courses seat 90 students. Data on the total number of absences per section was collected for one fall semester, and is as follows:**

| General Chemistry I | 162 | 140 | 136 | 171 | 106 | 148 |
|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **College Algebra** | **158** | **132** | **135** | **187** | **106** | **150** |

```{r}
m1 <- c(162,140,136,171,106,148)
m2 <- c(158,132,135,187,106,150)

math <-tibble(m1,m2)
```

**a. Find the appropriate summary statistics to summarize the data.**

```{r}
math %>% 
summarize(mean(m1),
median(m1),
sd(m1))

math %>% 
summarize(mean(m2),
median(m2),
sd(m2))
```

**b. Perform the appropriate *t* test to determine if there are fewer absences in College Algebra. Remember to typeset the hypothesis test results.**

```{r}
t.test(m2, m1,
       data = math,
alternative = "less")

```
Hypothesis:
  
    Ho : Mu_m2 > Mu_m1
    H1 : Mu_m2 < Mu_m1
    
  Test Statistic:
    to= 0.057323
    
  p-value:
    p-value = 0.5223 > 0.05
    
  Conclusion/ Interpretation:
    Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis. There is not enough sufficient evidence to suggest that there are fewer absences in College Algebra than General Chemistry I.
    
    
**c. Perform the appropriate nonparametric test to determine if there are fewer absences in College Algebra. Remember to typeset the hypothesis test results.**

```{r}
wilcox.test(m2, m1,
data = math,
alternative = "less")
```
  Hypothesis:
  
    Ho : M_m2 > M_m1
    H1 : M_m2 < M_m1
    
  Test Statistic:
    to= 16.5
    
  p-value:
    p-value = 0.4363 > 0.05
    
  Conclusion/ Interpretation:
    Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis. There is not enough sufficient evidence to suggest that there are fewer absences in College Algebra than General Chemistry I.
    
    
**d. Construct the necessary graphs / hypothesis tests to assess the assumptions on the *t* test.**

```{r}
math %>%
mutate(diff = m2 - m1) %>%
ggplot(aes(sample = diff)) +
stat_qq(size=3) +
stat_qq_line() +
theme_minimal() +
xlab("Theoretical") +
ylab("Sample")
```


**e. State the assumption(s) on the *t* test and provide your assessment based on results in part (d).**
  Based on my findings, the QQ plot graph shows an approximate 45 degree line, so we can assumed normality between the two groups (General Chemistry I and College Algebra). And based on the t.test, 
we fail to reject Null Hypothesis because There is not enough sufficient evidence to suggest that there are fewer absences in College Algebra. since the  p-value = 0.5223 > 0.05.

    
**f. Based on your assessment in part (e), are you going to report the *t* test or the nonparametric test?**
I will report the t.test since in part (e), we can assume normality between the two groups (General Chemistry I and College Algebra) because the QQ plot shows an approximate 45 degree line. 

    
**g. Construct a graph to help explain the results from the analysis chosen in part (f).**
```{r}
mean <- math %>% summarize(mean = mean(m1))

ggplot(mean, aes(x = 6, y = mean)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  ylim(range(c(140, 150))) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Number of Sections", y = "Mean Value", title = "Plot of Means for General Chemistry I")








means2 <- math %>% summarize(mean = mean(m2))

ggplot(means2, aes(x = 6, y = mean)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  ylim(range(c(140, 150))) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Number of Sections", y = "Mean Value", title = "Plot of Means for College Algebra")
```
Based on the plot of means paragraph for the two groups(General Chemistry I and College Algebra), you can see that the means value is higher for college algebra than the mean value for General Chemistry I. 
This indicates that there is a higher average absence for students in College Algebra than General Chemistry I.
    
**h. Write a brief paragraph describing the results of your analysis. Include summary statistics, results of your chosen hypothesis test from part (f), and the graph from part (g).**
Based on the t-test, we fail reject the null hypothesis (p-value = 0.5223 > 0.05), saying that there is not enough sufficient evidence to suggest that there are fewer absences in College Algebra 
than General Chemistry I. The QQ plot assumes normality in the two groups so we would use a parametric test instead of a nonparametric test to report the analysis. The plot of means clearly shows the mean 
value for College Algebra is higher than General Chemistry I, indicating a higher average absence for students in College Algebra than General Chemistry I.
