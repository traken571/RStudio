A large credit union awards quarterly bonuses to its employees. To ensure fairness across departments, data on the bonuses are regularly reviewed for equality. 
Consider the data in the following Google Sheet, which includes the bonus percentage for each employee in two departments.

```{r}
data <- as_tibble(gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q0Ouhr6hGBDp-5oyQuYGcsWTLrsayywVHJS7o17Sm6Y/edit?usp=sharing"))
head(data)
table(data$Department)
```

**1. From last lab! Use the appropriate parametric test to determine if the two departments are given different bonus amounts. Test at the $\alpha=0.01$ level. Remember to typeset the results.**

```{r}
t.test(Bonus ~ Department, data=data, alternative = "two")


```
Reject Null Hypothesis at the alpha = 0.01. There is sufficient evidence to suggest the two departments are given different bonus amounts

**2. Use the appropriate nonparametric test to determine if the two departments are given different bonus amounts. Test at the $\alpha=0.01$ level. Remember to typeset the results.**

```{r}
wilcox.test(Bonus ~ Department,
data = data,
alternative = "two",
paired = FALSE)


```
Hypotheses

\(H_0: \ \mu_{\text{Credit}} [\text{=}] \mu_{\text{Mortgage}}\)

\(H_1: \ \mu_{\text{Credit}} [\text{â‰ }] \mu_{\text{Mortgage}}\)

Test Statistic and p-Value

\(T_0 = \text{683}\)
\(p = \text{0.0001526}\)

Rejection Region

Reject \(H_0\) if \(p < \alpha\); \(\alpha = \text{.01}\).

Conclusion/Interpretation

Reject \(H_0\) at the alpha = 0.01. There is sufficient evidence to suggest the two departments are given different bonuses.



**3. Assess the assumption(s) associated with the test in question 1. In your assessment, determine (and state!) if the parametric or nonparametric test should be reported.**

```{r}

data %>%
filter(Department == "Mortgage") %>%
ggplot(aes(sample = Bonus)) +
stat_qq(size=3) +
stat_qq_line() +
theme_minimal() +
xlab("Theoretical") +
ylab("Sample")

data %>%
filter(Department == "Credit") %>%
ggplot(aes(sample = Bonus)) +
stat_qq(size=3) +
stat_qq_line() +
theme_minimal() +
xlab("Theoretical") +
ylab("Sample")


```
For the QQ plot the bonuses given in the Mortgage department are normally distributed. 
While the bonuses given in the Credit department are not normally distributed because of the outliers in the graph. 
Because of this, the nonparametric test should be reported. 

**4. Write a brief paragraph explaining your findings to management, based on the test chosen in question 3.**

For the QQ plot it shows that the bonuses in the Mortgage department are normally distributed while the the bonuses given in the Credit 
department are not normally distributed because of the outliers in the graph. And based on the nonparametric test, we reject the null hypothesis which 
stats that there is sufficient evidence to suggest the two departments are given different bonus amounts since pvalue = 0.0001526 is less than alpha=0.01 level.
